# SuperFan Source, Tech Elevator Final Capstone
â€‹This repository was my final capstone project at Tech Elevator coding bootcamp.
I collaborated with 3 classmates to create this application, and am very proud of how it turned out!
This project was created over the course of two weeks, and is the product of several sleepless nights. 

The idea of this project was to make a site where users can connect with their favorite bands! Users are also
able to create their own band pages, and send messages to their followers.

I am particularly proud of the photo gallery implementation, which was almost completely implemented by me in one sleepless night.
I am also proud of my interesting solution to making each page have different styling based on the genre of the band being viewed.

If you are curious about how anything in here works, I am happy to share! Feel free to reach out on linked in!
